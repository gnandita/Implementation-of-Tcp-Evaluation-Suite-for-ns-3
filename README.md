# Implementation-of-Tcp-Evaluation-suite-for-ns-3

## Course Code: CS

### Overview:
Tcp Evaluation Suite helps to compare TCP extensions with each other using metrics such as queue delay and average throughput.RFC 1231 has proposed a common TCP evaluation suite that specifies the standard scenarios,test cases and metrics for comparision.Our aim is to implement some of the scenarios in the RFC.Some work has already been done in this area.We extend this by porting it to ns-3-dev and by adding AQM support.
