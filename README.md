# Implementation of TCP Evaluation Suite for ns-3

## Course Code: CS898

### Overview:

TCP Evaluation Suite helps to compare TCP extensions with each other using metrics such as queue delay and average throughput. Internet draft [1] has proposed a common TCP evaluation suite that specifies the standard scenarios,test cases and metrics for comparision. A TCP evaluation tool for ns-2 is implemented in [2].The paper [3] simulates some of the scenaros described in [1] using ns-3 traffic. We extend this by porting it to ns-3-dev and by adding more scenarios and AQM support. The reference code for the paper [3] is present in [4].
