# Implementation-of-Tcp-Evaluation-suite-for-ns-3

## Course Code: CS898

### Overview:

Tcp Evaluation Suite helps to compare TCP extensions with each other using metrics such as queue delay and average throughput.Internet draft [1] has proposed a common TCP evaluation suite that specifies the standard scenarios,test cases and metrics for comparision.The paper [2] simulates some of the scenaros described in [1] using ns-3 traffic.The paper [3] uses realistic traffic generated by Tmix to simulate the scenarios. We extend this by porting it to ns-3-dev and by adding more scenarios and AQM support.THe reference code for the paper [2] is present in [4] and for the paper [3] can be found in [5].
